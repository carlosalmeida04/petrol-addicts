# Petrol Addicts

**<h3>About this project</h3>**
My high school graduation was in a professional course (a more practical and specific course than a regular one), and to finish it, you need to do it a thing that's called [PAP](https://forum.pt/ensino-profissional/pap-prova-o-que-vales), or you won't get your graduation. It has to be a project, specific from the are of the course you are on, in my case, programming. 

I love cars, so I decided to make a social media app dedicated to cars. 

At first, I though making it only for Android in ``Kotlin``, but then I read about ``React Native``, which would open the possibility to develop for iOS and Android with the same code base using **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)**. So I chose this technology and started learning it to proceed development. 

As I started learning the technology, I started seeing a bunch of tutorials teachinh how to use it with **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**, so I chose it as my database straight a way.
