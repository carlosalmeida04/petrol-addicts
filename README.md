# Petrol Addicts

**<h2>About this project</h2>**
My high school graduation was in a professional course (a more practical and specific course than a regular one), and to finish it, you need to do it a thing that's called [PAP](https://forum.pt/ensino-profissional/pap-prova-o-que-vales), or you won't get your graduation. It has to be a project, specific from the are of the course you are on, in my case, programming. 

I love cars, so I decided to make a social media app dedicated to cars. 

At first, I though making it only for Android in ``Kotlin``, but then I read about ``React Native``, which would open the possibility to develop for iOS and Android with the same code base using **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)**. So I chose this technology and started learning it to proceed development. 

As I started learning the technology, I started seeing a bunch of tutorials teaching how to use it with **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**, so I chose it as my database straight a way.

2. Install the Expo-CLI 
    ```psw 
    npm i -g expo-cli 
    ``` 
3. Then open the project with your prefered code editor, open a terminal window and install **``node_modules``**
    ```psw 
    npm install
    ```
### 2. Getting the project up and running

Now, to run and open the app: 

1. Install the **[Expo Go App](https://expo.dev/client)** on your mobile phone
2. In the terminal type to start the application
    ```psw 
    expo start
    ```
3. This will open a **[tab](https://github.com/carlosalmeida04/petrol-addicts/blob/master/assets/img/mdimages/expo%20console.png)** on your browser
4. Open the Expo Go App on your phone, and scan the QR Code that appears on the browser. Additionally, you can run it on a iOS Simulator by pressing **``Run on iOS Simulator``** or on an Android Emulator **``Run Android device/simulator``** .
